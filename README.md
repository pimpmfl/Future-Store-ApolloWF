# Future-Store-ApolloWF

## About
This project focuses on creating an Apollo workflow that triggers AWS Lambda functions to identify customers in a store, register new ones, notify the storage about an open order of a customer when it enters the store and also send push notifications to customers in the store about all promotions/offers.

The pictures of the customers entering the store are run through Amazon Rekognition.
